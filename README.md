# WeatherApp 📱☁️

Project Overview 🌦️

WeatherApp is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind. It is divided into multiple feature and core modules, encouraging a modularized and testable codebase.

## Features

- **Search for City Weather**: Enter a city name to get current weather information, including temperature, humidity, and more.
- **Detailed Weather View**: Dive into detailed weather data with an intuitive interface.

## Architecture

The app follows a modular architecture pattern, separating concerns into distinct layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: Handles UI components using Jetpack Compose.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and repository interfaces.
- **Data Layer**: Manages data sources, including remote API calls and local storage.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Kotlin**: The primary language for app development.
- **Jetpack Compose**: For building the UI.
- **Ktor**: For making network requests.
- **Koin**: For dependency injection.
- **Coroutines and Flow**: For asynchronous programming and state management.
- **Data Store**: For data Persistence.
